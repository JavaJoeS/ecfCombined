category.id.core=ECF SDK for Eclipse

category.members.core=org.eclipse.ecf.core,org.eclipse.ecf.core.source

category.id.rmt=ECF Remote Services SDK
category.description.rmt=ECF's Remote Services/Remote Service Admin SDK.  Included are ECF's implementation of the OSGi Remote Services and RSA specifications, multiple discovery providers (e.g. dnssd, zeroconf, jslp), multiple distribution providers (r-osgi and generic), ECF's implementation of Distributed EventAdmin, and remote services examples.  The RS SDK does not include any Eclipse-specific tooling, and so can/may be installed into non-Eclipse OSGi environments (e.g. Karaf, etc).  If the Eclipse-specific tooling (Remote Services perspective) is desired, please install the ECF SDK for Eclipse.
