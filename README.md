## Eclipse Communications Framework

ECF is a set of frameworks for building communications into applications. 

### Remote Services
ECF provides a lightweight, modular, transport-independent, fully-compliant implementation of the OSGi Remote Services standard.

### Github Organization
ECF Also has an [ECF Organization with a number of other repos](https://github.com/ECF) containing Remote Services distribution and discovery providers (e.g. grpc, jax-rs/jersey, etcd, hazelcast, others), more examples.   Most of these other repos depend upon the ECF Remote Services implementation provided by this repo.
